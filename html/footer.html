                        <strong>Q1: What is Lorem Ipsum?</strong><br>
                        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.<br>
                        Vivamus lacinia odio vitae vestibulum vestibulum. Cras venenatis euismod
                        malesuada.<br><br>

                        <strong>Q2: Why do we use it?</strong><br>
                        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a
                        page when looking at its layout.<br>
                        The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of
                        letters,<br>
                        as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable
                        English.<br><br>

                        <strong>Q3: Where does it come from?</strong><br>
                        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.<br>
                        It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years
                        old.<br>
                        Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one
                        of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur,<br>
                        from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature,
                        discovered the undoubtable source.<br><br>

                        <strong>Q4: Where can I get some?</strong><br>
                        There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have
                        suffered alteration in some form,<br>
                        by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable.<br>
                        If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything
                        embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.
